📌 Java Error: Class 'X' is public, should be declared in a file named 'X.java'
🔎 What does it mean?

In Java, if a class is declared as public, the filename must exactly match the class name (case-sensitive).

Otherwise, the compiler throws this error.

⚠️ Example (Error Case)

File name: Main.java

public class cellphone {
    // code
}


❌ Error: Class 'cellphone' is public, should be declared in a file named 'cellphone.java'

✅ Fixes

Rename the file to match the class name

Class: public class cellphone

File: cellphone.java

OR remove public keyword (only if public access isn’t required)

class cellphone {
    // code
}


Then the file name can be anything (e.g., Main.java).

📖 Java Naming Convention

Class names should start with an uppercase letter.
Example:

public class Cellphone


→ File must be: Cellphone.java

✅ Key Rule to Remember
Public class name = File name (exactly, case-sensitive).
